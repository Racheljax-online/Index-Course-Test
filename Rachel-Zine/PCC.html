     <p>Produced by Bob Albrecht & George Firedrake in Menlo Park, California from the early 70s onward, the People's Computer Center, the People's Computer Company Newsletters, and DragonSmoke were a vital early spark that helped ignite the culture of people having a personal and creative relationship with computers. Many things came out of the PCC, which will be described on these pages in the coming months. PCC helped to spawn Dr. Dobb's journal and itself morphed into Recreational Computing magazine by the end of the 1970s. Each issue has a dragon theme on the cover or somewhere within especially in the classic DragonSmoke pieces found in most issues.

            <p>PCC was one of the first organizations to recognize the potential of Tiny BASIC in the nascent field of personal computing when it published that language's design specification in their newsletter. This ultimately led to the design of an interpreter that was published in a publication, which they named Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics and Orthodontia, dedicated to Tiny BASIC. The newsletter's title was changed to Dr. Dobb's Journal of Computer Calisthenics & Orthodontia for the second issue; the popular reaction to it eventually led to the long-running computer magazine Dr. Dobb's Journal which continued publication until 2009.
                <br><br>
                PCC was among the first organizations to recognize and actively advocate playing as a legitimate way of learning. It published arguably the first best-seller in microcomputer literature, My Computer Likes Me When I Speak BASIC[4] and What to Do After You Hit Return. The company was an early proponent of software without copyright, and published much of it in the above books, in DDJ and in another periodical. That magazine originally shared the company's name but it evolved and was later renamed Recreational Computing. It focused on publishing code listings, mostly for games, that users could hand type into their early-model (and some homebrew) personal computers. Because the code was without copyright, authors were free to study it, adapt, rewrite and build upon it. The same was true of the more systems-oriented code published in DDJ. This no-copyright practice was a significant boost to the growing body of microcomputer software and applications, and to the general base of knowledge and developing best practices in the young industry.
                <br><br>
                PCC also fostered the activities of its child organization, ComputerTown USA! That formalized PCC's long-standing activism around general computer literacy. At a time when many computers still were kept in clean rooms, PCC was taking them to libraries, grade schools and elder communities. Their activities encouraged hands-on exploration and just trying things. The Logo programming language and turtle graphics gave some users their first experience of controlling something on a computer display. Computer phobia was commonly perceived by PCC staff as a barrier to learning in a significant number of users, even in a large majority of some populations during those early years. Apple Computer's Community Affairs department used ComputerTown USA! to develop curriculum and to conduct intensive trainings for the non-profit recipients of computer hardware and software grants from Apple.
                <br><br>
                As one of its core philosophical contributions, People's Computer Company recognized in personal computing a great potential for individual empowerment and social improvement. It saw that PCs could bring the same advantages to those hampered by race, class and circumstance as to those with more advantages. It believed a digital commons could lead to more intermingling of individuals from diverse social groups. It supported early models of networking personal computers using telephone lines. It could, in hindsight, be regarded as among the first contributors to a form of what is known now as network neutrality and a fundamentally non-commercial, class-free internet.

                The history of PCC and its role in the evolution of the personal computer was described in Steven Levy's book, Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution. In Levy's book, some of the values and ethics of PCC's founders are examined, particularly the ethics common among members of the hacker community.

        <p>AUGUST 1978 | MICHAEL ROSSMAN</p>
        
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>During the late 1960s, as networks of alternative human service agencies and groups working for social change developed in America, three levels of information-processing need became apparent.
        <br><br>

        In dealing with staff, clients, and community, a typical organization needed easily-accessible and continuously- updated information about a great variety of persons, activities, informational and other resources, etc. Within each network of groups of some particular sort, the same need was experienced; often the network's evolution depended vitally upon its satisfying this need, as did the local work of each group. Finally, as networks multiplied and their works developed. the same need appeared among them as a collectivity: how could the whole be accessed to itself?
        <br><br>

        Primitive answers to these needs appeared in the filing-systems of local agencies, in networking newsletters, and in such ventures of inter-network accessing as the many Peoples' Yellow Pages. But other answers were being explored. In 1971, Project One. the first modern "warehouse community." came together in San Francisco. In its huge, converted warehouse, fifty groups, covering the change-spectrum from prison reform, to community media, to artists and video- freaks, to a free school, to legal aid. were hived together, bringing the many cur- rents of information and work they rep- resented into an intense interplay. It was a partial answer to the problem and potential of accessing the whole to itself, but promising enough so that the warehouse community form was explored in many cities through the mid-1970s.
        <br><br>
            
         It was fitting, then, that in the very basement of Project One, a small group of technological visionaries were at work on tools which promised new powers to meet such informational needs (and quite a variety of others). The men and women of Resource One were no razzle-dazzle crew, but a bunch of pragmatic kids at play with a cumbersome, antiquated XDS-940 computer scrounged from a friendly corporation. Intent on turning cybernetic technology to direct community service and guided by clear political insights rare in the cybernetic field, by 1974 they had developed a system called Community Memory, as remarkable and luminous in its implications as it was simple and funky in its first field test.
