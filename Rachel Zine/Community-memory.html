        <p>EXCERPT FROM ORIGINAL SITE | MARK SZPAKOWSKI </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
     <p>Community Memory was the world's first public computerized bulletin board system. It was created by Efrem Lipkin, Mark Szpakowski, and Lee Felsenstein, acting as the Community Memory Project. Lee took care of hardware, Efrem software, and Mark user interface and information husbandry. A second incarnation of Community Memory, aimed at creating a global information network, appeared in the later seventies. Its major players were Efrem Lipkin and Ken Colstad.
        <br>
        <br>
        Community Memory ran off an XDS-940 timesharing computer located in Resource One in San Francisco. The first terminal was an ASR-33 Teletype at the top of the stairs leading to Leopold's Records in Berkeley. You could leave messages and attach keywords to them. Other people could then find messages by those keywords.
    <br>
    <br>
    The line from San Francisco to Berkeley ran at 110 baud - 10 characters per second. The teletype was noisy, so it was encased in a cardboard box, with a transparent plastic top so you could see what was being printed out, and holes for your hands so you could type. It made for some magic moments with the Allman Brothers' "Blue Sky" playing in the record store. Musicians loved it - they ended up generating a monthly printout of fusion rock bassists seeking raga lead guitars. And out of it also emerged the first net.personality - Benway, as he called himself.

            <p>COMMUNITY MEMORY is the name we give to this experimental information service. It is an attempt to harness the power of the computer in the service of the community. We hope to do this by providing a sort of super bulletin board where people can post notices of all sorts and can find the notices posted by others rapidly.
                We are Loving Grace Cybernetics, a group of Berkeley people operating out of Resource One Inc., a non-profit collective located in Project One in S.F. Resource One grew out of the San Francisco Switchboard and has managed to obtain control of a computer (XDS 940) for use in communications.
                ...
                While we're setting up, using the system will be free, but it must be able to support itself in a way that keeps it available to everyone. So we will experiment with various ways of doing this. Initially, we'll charge for adding and finding items in which money changes hands, and hope this supports free use of the system for informational services.
                Our intention is to introduce COMMUNITY MEMORY into neighborhoods and communities in this area, and make it available for them to live with it, play with it, and shape its growth and development. The idea is to work with a process whereby technological tools, like computers, are used by the people themselves to shape their own lives and communities in sane and liberating ways. In this case the computer enables the creation of a communal memory bank, accessible to anyone in the community. With this, we can work on providing the information, services, skills, education, and economic strength our community needs. We have a powerful tool -- a genie -- at our disposal; the question is whether we can integrate it into our lives, support it, and use it to improve our own lives and survival capabilities. We invite your participation and suggestions.

        <p>AUGUST 1978 | MICHAEL ROSSMAN</p>
        
        <br>
        <br>

        <p>During the late 1960s, as networks of alternative human service agencies and groups working for social change developed in America, three levels of information-processing need became apparent.
        <br><br>

        In dealing with staff, clients, and community, a typical organization needed easily-accessible and continuously- updated information about a great variety of persons, activities, informational and other resources, etc. Within each network of groups of some particular sort, the same need was experienced; often the network's evolution depended vitally upon its satisfying this need, as did the local work of each group. Finally, as networks multiplied and their works developed. the same need appeared among them as a collectivity: how could the whole be accessed to itself?
        <br><br>

        Primitive answers to these needs appeared in the filing-systems of local agencies, in networking newsletters, and in such ventures of inter-network accessing as the many Peoples' Yellow Pages. But other answers were being explored. In 1971, Project One. the first modern "warehouse community." came together in San Francisco. In its huge, converted warehouse, fifty groups, covering the change-spectrum from prison reform, to community media, to artists and video- freaks, to a free school, to legal aid. were hived together, bringing the many cur- rents of information and work they rep- resented into an intense interplay. It was a partial answer to the problem and potential of accessing the whole to itself, but promising enough so that the warehouse community form was explored in many cities through the mid-1970s.
        <br><br>
            
         It was fitting, then, that in the very basement of Project One, a small group of technological visionaries were at work on tools which promised new powers to meet such informational needs (and quite a variety of others). The men and women of Resource One were no razzle-dazzle crew, but a bunch of pragmatic kids at play with a cumbersome, antiquated XDS-940 computer scrounged from a friendly corporation. Intent on turning cybernetic technology to direct community service and guided by clear political insights rare in the cybernetic field, by 1974 they had developed a system called Community Memory, as remarkable and luminous in its implications as it was simple and funky in its first field test.
